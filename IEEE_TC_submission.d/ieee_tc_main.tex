% facilitates dual compilation, although admittedly the differences in the
% desired content of \author between the different types of papers makes a
% one-size-fits-all approach a daunting prospect. For instance, compsoc 
% journal papers have the author affiliations above the "Manuscript

% \thanks is no different in this regard, so shield the last } of each \thanks
% that ends a line with a % and do not let a space in before the next \thanks.
% Spaces after \IEEEmembership other than the last one are OK (and needed) as

\begin{abstract}
%%The abstract goes here.
A class of Boolean functions, 
called \textbf{nested canalyzing functions} (NCFs),
has been used to model certain biological phenomena.
Researchers have studied some properties of these functions
such as sensitivity and stability.
In this note, we examine the relationships between NCFs, symmetric
Boolean functions and a more general form of symmetric Boolean functions,
called $r$-symmetric functions (where $r$ is the symmetry level).
Using a standard representation for NCFs, we develop a
characterization of when two variables of an NCF are symmetric.
Using this characterization, we show
that the symmetry level of an NCF $f$
can be easily computed given a standard representation of $f$.
(In contrast, we prove that even approximating the symmetry level of
a general Boolean function to within any factor $\geq 1$ is \cnp-hard.)
We also show that for any NCF $f$ with $n$ variables, the notion of
strong asymmetry considered in the literature is equivalent to
the property that $f$ is $n$-symmetric. 
We use this result to derive a closed form expression for the
number of $n$-variable Boolean functions
that are NCFs and strongly asymmetric.
In addition, we identify all the Boolean functions that are NCFs
and symmetric.

%%\IEEEraisesectionheading{\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}}

% Computer Society journal (but not conference!) papers do something unusual
% with the very first section heading (almost always called "Introduction").
% They place it ABOVE the main text! IEEEtran.cls does not automatically do
% this for you, but you can achieve this effect with the provided
% \IEEEraisesectionheading{} command. Note the need to keep any \label that
% is to refer to the section immediately after \section in the above as
% \IEEEraisesectionheading puts \section within a raised box.

% The very first letter is a 2 line initial drop letter followed
% by the rest of the first word in caps (small caps for compsoc).
% 
% form to use if the first word consists of a single letter:
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{demo} file is ....
% 
% form to use if you need the single drop letter followed by
% normal text (unknown if ever used by the IEEE):
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{}demo file is ....
% 
% Some journals put the first two words in caps:
% \IEEEPARstart{T}{his demo} file is ....
% 
% Here we have the typical use of a "T" for an initial drop letter
% and "HIS" in caps to complete the first word.

%% \IEEEPARstart{T}{his} demo file is intended to serve as a ``starter file''
%% for IEEE Computer Society journal papers produced under \LaTeX\ using
%% IEEEtran.cls version 1.8b and later.

% You must have at least 2 lines in the paragraph with the drop letter
% (should never be an issue)
