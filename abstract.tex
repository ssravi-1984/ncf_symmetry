Several researchers have studied 
a class of Boolean functions, 
called \textbf{nested canalyzing functions} (NCFs),
which are used to model certain biological 
phenomena \cite{Kauffman-1969,Kauffman-etal-2003,Kauffman-etal-2004}.
We study the relationships between NCFs and symmetric 
Boolean functions. Our results ...
