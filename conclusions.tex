\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:concl}

We examined the relationships between NCFs and 
symmetric functions. 
We showed that given the normalized representation
of an NCF, its symmetry level can be easily computed.
We also showed that an NCF with $n$ variables is 
strongly asymmetric iff it is properly $n$symmetric.
