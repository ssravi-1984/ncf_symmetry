Many researchers have studied symmetry properties of various Boolean
functions.  A class of Boolean functions, called nested canalyzing
functions (NCFs), has been used to model certain biological phenomena.
The purpose of this brief contribution is to bring out some interesting
relationships between NCFs, symmetric Boolean functions and a
generalization of symmetric Boolean functions, which we call
r-symmetric functions (where r is the symmetry level).  Using a
normalized representation for NCFs, we develop a characterization
of when two variables of an NCF are symmetric.  Using this
characterization, we show that the symmetry level of an NCF f can
be easily computed given a standard representation of f.  We also
present an efficient algorithm for testing whether a given r-symmetric
function is an NCF.  Further, we show that for any NCF f with n
variables, the notion of strong asymmetry considered in the literature
is equivalent to the property that f is n-symmetric.  We use this
result to derive a closed form expression for the number of n-variable
Boolean functions that are NCFs and strongly asymmetric.  We also
identify all the Boolean functions that are NCFs and symmetric.
